\subsection{Introduction}
\subsubsection{\nameref{section:introduction:machine-learning}}
Definitions in this section are based on Section 2.1 in \cite{shalevshwartz_2014_understanding}.
\subsubsection{\nameref{section:introduction:deep-learning}}
Definitions in this section and descriptions of loss functions and algorithms are based on \cite{higham_2018_deep}. Neural network graph figures are based on figures displayed on websites \cite{neutelings_neural} and \cite{stutz_2020_illustrating}. 
The proof of \nameref{proposition:introduction:backward:naive} is based on the proof of Lemma 1 in \cite{higham_2018_deep} and the discussion from Section 6.2.3 in \cite{calin_2020_deep}.
