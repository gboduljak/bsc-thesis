\subsection{Fourier Transform on $\Ltwo(\R^n)$}

Using the fact that $\Lone(\R^n) \cap \Ltwo(\R^n)$ is dense in $\Ltwo(\R^n)$, it is possible to extend the theory we developed for $\Lone(\R^n)$ to $\Ltwo(\R^n)$. For a detailed and careful argument, see the section 2.2.4 in \cite{loukasgrafakos_2014_classical}.
