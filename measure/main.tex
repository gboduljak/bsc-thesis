\section{Measure Theory and Integration}
\label{section:appendix:measure}
This section is a concise summary of elementary definitions and results from measure theory. The aim is to set up notation for later more advanced sections. The majority of the presented results have been discussed in \textit{Essentials in Analysis and Probability}, although Carath√©odory's theorem is given in a more general form suitable for applications in this thesis. The material about signed measures and decomposition theorems was not part of the syllabus and it is discussed in more detail.
